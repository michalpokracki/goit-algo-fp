## Conclusion

The Monte Carlo simulation closely matches the theoretical probabilities of rolling two dice. The minor discrepancies are due to the random nature of the simulation and the finite number of throws. Increasing the number of throws would further reduce these discrepancies, as the Law of Large Numbers dictates that the simulated probabilities should converge to the theoretical values with more trials.
